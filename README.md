# HOSPITAL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-JDBC
This project is a Hospital Management System implemented using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

The Hospital Management System allows hospital staff to manage patient records, appointments, and medical history. It also provides functionalities for doctors to view patient information, prescribe medications, and schedule appointments.

The system is built using Java programming language and MySQL database for storing and retrieving data. JDBC is used to establish a connection between the Java application and the database, allowing for seamless integration and data manipulation.

Key features of the Hospital Management System include:

Patient registration and management
Appointment scheduling
Doctor and staff management
View patient name
View doctors name
Billing and payment processing (upcoming soon)
This project aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for hospital management, improving the overall workflow and patient care.
